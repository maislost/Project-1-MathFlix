# Project-1-MathFlix
My first page in HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript. The objective of this activity is for trainning my hardskills in back end and front end web.
Two files were created.
The file "form-login.html" simulates a login page on the site redirecting the user to the main page file "index.html".
